# INCLUDE operators

This topic describes the INCLUDE operators. These operators are used to check whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object includes the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in a specified dimension.

## Syntax

```
{geometry, trajectory, boxndf} /@>/ {geometry, trajectory, boxndf}
{trajectory, boxndf} #@># {trajectory, boxndf}
{geometry, trajectory, boxndf} @> {geometry, trajectory, boxndf}
{geometry, trajectory, boxndf} @/> {geometry, trajectory, boxndf}
{trajectory, boxndf} @#> {trajectory, boxndf}
{trajectory, boxndf} @/#> {trajectory, boxndf}
```

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Left operand|The object whose bounding box you want to compare.|
|Right operand|The object whose bounding box you want to compare.|

## Description

The INCLUDE operators allow you to check whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object includes the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in a specified dimension. These bounding boxes are generated by the ST\_MakeBox function. For more information, see [ST\_MakeBox](/intl.en-US/Spatio-temporal Database/Trajectory SQL reference/Functions to process bounding boxes/ST_MakeBox.md). The effect of the INCLUDE operators is opposite to that of the INCLUDED operators. For more information, see [INCLUDED operators](/intl.en-US/Spatio-temporal Database/Trajectory SQL reference/Operators to process bounding boxes/INCLUDED operators.md).

The following INCLUDE operators are supported:

-   `/@>/`: checks whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object includes the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in the z dimension.
-   `#@>#`: checks whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object includes the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in the t dimension.
-   `@>`: checks whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object includes the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in the x and y dimensions.
-   `@&>`: checks whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object includes the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in the x, y, and z dimensions.
-   `<#@`: checks whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object is included in the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in the x, y, and t dimensions.
-   `@/#>`: checks whether the bounding box of the left operand-specified object is included in the bounding box of the right operand-specified object in the x, y, z, and t dimensions.

## Example

```
WITH box AS(
    SELECT ST_MakeBox3dt(0,0,0, '2010-01-01 00:00:00',10,10,10, '2012-01-01 00:00:00') a,
           ST_MakeBox3dt(6,6,3,'2010-01-01 00:00:00',8,8,5,'2013-01-01 00:00:00') b
)
SELECT a /@>/ b AS OpZ, a #@># b AS OpT, a @> b AS Op2D, a @/> b AS Op3D, a @#> b AS Op2DT, a @/#> b AS Op3DT from box;
 opz | opt | op2d | op3d | op2dt | op3dt 
-----+-----+------+------+-------+-------
 t   | f   | t    | t    | f     | f
```
