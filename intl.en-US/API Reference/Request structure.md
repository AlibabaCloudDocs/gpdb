# Request structure

To send an API request, you must send an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint. You must add the request parameters that correspond to the API operation being called. After you call the API, the system returns a response.

## Endpoints

The endpoint of the API is gpdb.aliyuncs.com.

## Protocols

You can call API operations by sending HTTP or HTTPS requests. For security purposes, we recommend that you send HTTPS requests. Some password-related API operations only support HTTPS.

## Methods

The system allows you to send HTTP GET requests. This requires request parameters to be included in request URLs.

## Parameters

When you make an API request, you must set the Action parameter to the operation \(such as CreateDBInstance\) that you want to perform. You must also specify common request parameters and operation-specific request parameters.

## Encoding

Requests and responses are encoded in UTF-8.
