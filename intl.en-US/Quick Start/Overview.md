HybridDB for PostgreSQL is a distributed cloud database that is composed of multiple [groups](../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Concepts.md#) to provide MPP \(Massively Parallel Processing\) data warehousing service. HybridDB for PostgreSQL is developed based on the Greenplum Open Source Database program and is enhanced with some in-depth extensions by Alibaba Cloud.

HybridDB for PostgreSQL is compatible with the Greenplum environment and supports features including OSS storage, JSON data type, and HyperLogLog approximating analysis. For details about HybridDB features and limits, see [Features and limits](../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Features and limitations.md#).
