# What ETL tools does HybridDB for PostgreSQL currently support? How to synchronize data from other data sources to HybridDB for PostgreSQL on a regular basis? {#concept_ujs_lgg_v2b .concept}

The following ETL tools are supported:

-   [Alibaba Cloud Data Integration](https://www.aliyun.com/product/cdp/): an ETL tool provided by Alibaba Cloud. In Data Integration, you can configure HybridDB for PostgreSQL as a PostgreSQL database to synchronize data from other data sources \(RDS, MaxCompute, and TableStore\) to HybridDB for PostgreSQL.

    -   You can directly read data from other data sources, and write data to HybridDB for PostgreSQL.
    -   If the data size is big and concurrent imports are required, we recommend that you first import the data to OSS from other data sources by using Data Integration, and then import the data by using the OSS external table to HybridDB for PostgreSQL.
-   [Pentaho Kettle](http://community.pentaho.com/projects/data-integration/): an open-source ETL tool.

    -   You can import data through Kettle to an ephemeral disk first, and then import the data to HybridDB for PostgreSQL by using COPY or OSS.
    -   You can also mount an OSS instance as a virtual ephemeral disk, import data through Kettle to that disk, and then import data to HybridDB for PostgreSQL by using the OSS external table.
-   [Informatica](https://www.informatica.com/cn/): a commercial ETL tool.

-   [Bifrost](https://market.aliyun.com/products/56024006/cmjj011322.html): an ETL tool in Alibaba Cloud marketplace. It now provides commercial services.

-   [dbsync](https://github.com/aliyun/rds_dbsync/releases): an open-source database synchronization tool provided by Alibaba Cloud.

    -   Supports synchronizing data concurrently from MySQL and PostgreSQL to HybridDB for PostgreSQL.
    -   Supports simple data conversion.
    -   Supports parsing binlog to synchronize data from MySQL to HybridDB for PostgreSQL in a quasi-real-time manner.
-   Other ETL tools supporting Greenplum.
