# How do I reconfigure parameters?

You can reconfigure the parameters of a session used to establish a connection with your AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL instance. For more information, see the Greenplum documentation.

The statement used to reconfigure a parameter is as follows: `ALTER ROLE <The username of your account> SET <The name of the parameter> = <The new value of the parameter>`. This statement only takes effect on the specified user.

If you want to reconfigure instance-level parameters, submit a ticket or join the AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL technical support group on DingTalk. For more information, see [How do I obtain technical details about AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL?](/intl.en-US/FAQ/How do I obtain technical details about AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL?.md)
