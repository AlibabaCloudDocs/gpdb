# Change connection addresses {#concept_bcx_2gf_hfb .concept}

In HybridDB for PostgreSQL, you can change the connection address of an instance. For example, if you switch your service to a different HybridDB for PostgreSQL instance, you do not need to modify the application. You only need to configure the new instance to use the connection address of the old instance.

-   The instance is running.
-   The instance has set up a whitelist.
